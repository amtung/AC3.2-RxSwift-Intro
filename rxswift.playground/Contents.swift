/*
 Subject in RxSwift
 - Subject: acts as both an observable sequence (can be subscribed to) and observer (to add new elements, which will be emitted to the subjectâ€™s subscribers.
 
 1. PublishSubject
 - you need to specify the type of the PublishSubject on init
 - subscribers only receives events after they subscribe
 - but still receives onComplete and onError
 
 
 2. BehaviorSubject
 - subscriber receives the last event emitted, or the initialized value
 - but they still send/receive onComplete and onError
 
 
 3. ReplaySubject
 - receives a buffer of previous events, so it could the last n-number of events on a stream
 - receives them in the same order they occurred.
 
 
 4. Variable
 - Wraps a BehaviorSubject
 - Replays most recent next() event
 - Will not emit error event
 - Automatically completes when it is about to be deallocated
 - Uses dot-syntax to get or set latest value

 - Your friends that are present for you receiving events since the start, just observe the events the entire time you open presents. They're subscribed to your opening present observations
 - Your mother requesting info on the presents opened is like a *ReplaySubject*: she wants you to replay the present you received. In this case the presents are the events in your opening observation
 - Your friend that comes in and asks about your previous presents, you give him the last one you opened to shut him up and continue. Your friend is a BehaviorSubject, receiving info on the last present you got, plus everything going forward
 - Your other not so good friend just comes in for the cake/ambience. So they don't care about what has already occurred, but they pay attention to all further present opening events. They are like a PublishSubject
